# Deadpool Workspace Removal - Phase 1

This demonstrates removing the deadpool workspace structure to enable independent crate builds and resolve MSRV/dependency conflicts.

## What Has Been Done

### ✅ Workspace Structure Removed

1. **Removed workspace configuration** from the root `Cargo.toml`
   - Deleted the `[workspace]` section and `members` list
   - Each crate now operates independently with its own `Cargo.lock`

2. **Preserved path dependencies**
   - All existing path dependencies remain unchanged (e.g., `deadpool = { path = "../", version = "0.12.0" }`)
   - No dependency version changes made
   - Each crate resolves its own dependency tree independently

3. **Verified independent builds**
   - Each crate can now be built independently with `cargo check`
   - Resolves the libsqlite3-sys version conflicts between crates
   - Enables independent MSRV per crate

## Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Fixed dependency conflicts** - Each crate gets its own `Cargo.lock` and dependency resolution
- ✅ **Independent building** - Each crate builds without requiring workspace context  
- ✅ **MSRV flexibility** - Each crate can potentially have its own minimum Rust version
- ✅ **Preserves existing structure** - No dependency version changes, minimal disruption

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all crates build independently:

```powershell
.\test-individual-builds.ps1
```

Or test individual crates:

```bash
cd postgres && cargo check     # deadpool-postgres
cd diesel && cargo check      # deadpool-diesel  
cd redis && cargo check       # deadpool-redis
# etc.
```

## Key Differences from Previous Workspace Structure

### Before (Workspace)
- Single shared `Cargo.lock` at workspace root
- All crates had to use compatible dependency versions
- `cargo build --workspace` worked
- Version conflicts between crates (e.g., libsqlite3-sys)

### After (No Workspace)  
- Each crate has its own `Cargo.lock`
- Each crate resolves dependencies independently
- Must build crates individually: `cd crate && cargo build`
- No version conflicts - each crate picks optimal versions

## Next Steps (Future Considerations)

This change enables future possibilities:

1. **Independent MSRV** - Each crate could have its own minimum Rust version
2. **Dependency flexibility** - Crates can update dependencies at their own pace  
3. **Repository splitting** - If desired, each crate could become its own repository
4. **Focused CI/CD** - Build and test only what changes

## For Maintainers

- **Breaking change**: `cargo build --workspace` no longer works
- **CI changes needed**: Build each crate individually
- **Dependency updates**: Can now be done per-crate as needed
- **Publishing**: Each crate publishes independently (as before)

This provides the foundation for whatever dependency management strategy you prefer going forward.
